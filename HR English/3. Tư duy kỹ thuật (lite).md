## 1. **What’s the difference between an array and a linked list?**

**(Sự khác nhau giữa mảng và linked list là gì?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

1. **Array** → *Fixed size, index-based access, contiguous memory*
2. **Linked List** → *Dynamic size, sequential access, non-contiguous memory*
3. **Trade-off** → *Array = faster access; Linked list = faster insertion/deletion*

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *An array has a fixed size, stores elements in contiguous memory, and allows O(1) access by index but insertion or deletion is expensive. A linked list has dynamic size, elements linked by pointers, insertion and deletion are O(1) if you have the reference, but access is O(n).*

## 2. **Can you explain object-oriented programming (OOP) principles?**

**(Bạn có thể giải thích các nguyên tắc lập trình hướng đối tượng không?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

* **Encapsulation** → Group data + methods, hide internal details.
* **Inheritance** → Reuse properties/methods from a parent class.
* **Polymorphism** → Same method, different implementations.
* **Abstraction** → Show essential features, hide complexity.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *OOP has four main principles: Encapsulation to bundle data and methods together, Inheritance to reuse and extend behavior, Polymorphism to allow one interface with different implementations, and Abstraction to hide implementation details and show only necessary features.*

## 3. **What’s the difference between a process and a thread?**

**(Sự khác nhau giữa process và thread là gì?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

1. **Process** → Independent, has its own memory space.
2. **Thread** → Runs inside a process, shares memory with other threads.
3. **Performance** → Thread creation and switching is cheaper.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory space, while a thread is a smaller execution unit that runs inside a process and shares its memory. Threads are lighter and faster to create, but require careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.*

## 4. **How would you design a simple login system?**

**(Bạn sẽ thiết kế một hệ thống đăng nhập đơn giản như thế nào?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

1. **User registration** → Store hashed passwords, validate input.
2. **Login** → Compare hashed password with stored hash.
3. **Session management** → JWT or session cookies.
4. **Security** → HTTPS, rate limiting.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *I would store user credentials with hashed passwords using a secure algorithm like bcrypt. On login, I’d verify the hash, and if correct, issue a JWT token for stateless authentication. I’d also use HTTPS, input validation, and rate limiting for security.*

## 5. **Can you explain what an HTTP status code 404 means?**

**(Bạn có thể giải thích mã trạng thái HTTP 404 có nghĩa là gì không?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

* **Meaning** → Resource not found.
* **When used** → Client requests a non-existent resource.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *HTTP 404 means the requested resource could not be found on the server. It’s used when the URL is valid but the resource does not exist or has been deleted.*

## 6. **What is a RESTful API and how is it different from SOAP?**

**(RESTful API là gì và khác gì với SOAP?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

1. **REST** → Stateless, resource-based, JSON, uses HTTP verbs.
2. **SOAP** → XML-based protocol, strict format, more overhead.
3. **Key diff** → REST is simpler and lighter for web APIs.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *A RESTful API is a stateless architecture that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to work with resources, often returning JSON. SOAP is a protocol that uses XML messages with a strict structure, which is more verbose and heavier compared to REST.*

## 7. **What is normalization in databases?**

**(Chuẩn hóa trong cơ sở dữ liệu là gì?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

1. **Definition** → Organizing data to reduce redundancy.
2. **Goal** → Improve data integrity.
3. **Example** → Split user info into separate tables.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity. For example, separating customer details into one table and orders into another, linked by a foreign key.*

---

## 8. **What is ACID in databases?**

**(ACID trong cơ sở dữ liệu là gì?)**

**Cấu trúc gợi ý**

* **Atomicity** → All operations succeed or none.
* **Consistency** → DB stays valid before & after transaction.
* **Isolation** → Transactions don’t interfere.
* **Durability** → Once committed, changes persist.

**Ví dụ trả lời**

> *ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability — properties that guarantee reliable transactions in a database. Atomicity ensures all steps succeed or fail together, Consistency keeps the database valid, Isolation prevents interference between transactions, and Durability ensures data is saved even after a crash.*
